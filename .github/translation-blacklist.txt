# Translation Blacklist
# List files or patterns that should be excluded from automatic translation
# One pattern per line, supports glob patterns
# Lines starting with # are comments

# Example patterns:
# _quarto.yml
# README.md
# Template/**           # Exclude entire Template directory
# test-*.qmd            # Exclude test files in root
# **/test-*.qmd         # Exclude test files in any subdirectory
