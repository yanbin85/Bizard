Connected scatter is a type of chart that builds upon scatter by adding lines to connect the data points in a certain order. It allows us to discern not only the correlation between independent variable and dependent variable but also the trend in the data points.

## Example

![](../images/ConnectedScatter_demo.png){fig-alt="Histogram DEMO" fig-align="center" width="60%"}

In this figure, this is a basic connected scatter plot. The curve representing the change between `Sepal.Length` and `Sepal.Width`fluctuates up and down. However, overall, the dependent variable `Sepal.Length` increases as the independent variable `Sepal.Width` increases.

## Setup

-   System Requirements: Cross-platform (Linux/MacOS/Windows)

-   Programming Language: R

-   Dependencies: `ggplot2`, `dplyr`

```{r packages setup, message = FALSE}
# Install packages
if (!requireNamespace("ggplot2", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("ggplot2")
}
if (!requireNamespace("dplyr", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("dplyr")
}

# Load packages
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
```

```{r}
sessioninfo::session_info("attached")
```

## Data Preparation

The datasets used are the built-in R datasets `iris` and `economics`. The `iris` dataset contains measurements of sepal length and width, as well as petal length and width, for three species of iris plants. The `economics` dataset is a time series of U.S. economic data. Additionally, the [gene expression data for breast cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/download/?acc=GSE243555&format=file&file=GSE243555%5Fall%5Fgenes%5Fwith%5Fcounts%2Etxt%2Egz) from the `NCBI` database is used,which has 24 sample columns, and two rows of gene expression data are selected for plotting.

```{r load data, message = FALSE}
# 1.Load iris data
data("iris", package = "datasets")
data <- iris

# 2. Load and filter time series data
# To simplify the plotting process, only the data from December is selected to represent the entire year
data_economics <- economics %>%
  select(date, psavert, uempmed) %>%
  filter(str_detect(date, "-12-01")) %>%
  slice_head(n = 25) %>%
  mutate(date = str_extract(date, "^\\d{4}")) %>% #extracts the 4-digit year from the beginning of each date string.
  select(date, psavert, uempmed)

# 3.Load gene expression data (first two rows)
data_counts <- read.csv("https://bizard-1301043367.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/GSE243555_all_genes_with_counts.txt", sep = "\t", header = TRUE, nrows = 10)

axis_names <- data_counts[c(1, 2), 1]        # Save names

data_counts <- data_counts %>%      
  select(-1) %>%               # Remove first column
  slice(1:2) %>%               # remain the first two rows
  t()  %>%                     # Transpose
  as.data.frame() %>%
  setNames(c("V1", "V2"))      # Set column names

head(data_counts)
```


## Visualization

### 1. Basic Plotting
@fig-BasicHist was created by adding `geom_line` to the scatter plot.

```{r fig1BasicPlot}
#| label: fig-BasicHist
#| fig-cap: "Basic Plotting"
#| out.width: "95%"
#| warning: false

# Basic plotting, only adding `geom_line`
p <- ggplot(data[data$Species == "setosa", ], aes(x = Sepal.Width, y = Sepal.Length)) +
  geom_point(shape = 17, size = 1.5, color = "blue") +
  geom_line()

p
```


### 2. Set Line Styles
@fig-LineStyle sets the line direction, width, type, and color by parameters.

```{r fig2LineStyle}
#| label: fig-LineStyle
#| fig-cap: "Set Line Styles"
#| out.width: "95%"
#| warning: false

## Set line styles
p <- ggplot(data[data$Species == "setosa", ], aes(x = Sepal.Width, y = Sepal.Length)) +
  geom_point(shape = 17, size = 1.5, color = "blue") +
  geom_line(orientation = "x", linetype = 1, color = "red", linewidth = 0.1)

p
```


::: callout-tip
**Key Parameters: geom_line**

`linetype`:

`linetype` indicates the type of line, with optional values ranging from 0 to 6 (0 = blank, 1 = solid, 2 = dashed, 3 = dotted, 4 = dotdash, 5 = longdash, 6 = twodash). The specific shapes are shown in the following figure:

![](../images/ConnectedScatter_linetype.png){fig-align="center" width="60%"}

`orientation`:

The orientation of the line segment, with options "x" and "y". When `orientation="x"`, the line is plotted with x as the independent variable and y as the dependent variable.

`linewidth`:

The thickness of the line segment.
:::

### 3. Multiclass Data Plotting
@fig-Multi-classData_plot was created by using `color=Species`, `shape=Species`, and `linetype=Species` to map the categorical variable to multiple features.

```{r fig3Multi-classData_plot}
#| label: fig-Multi-classData_plot
#| fig-cap: "Multiclass Data Plotting"
#| out.width: "95%"
#| warning: false

## Multiclass Data Plotting
## Use `color=Species`,`shape=Species`,`linetype=Species` to map categorical variables to multiple features
p <- ggplot(
  data[data$Species == "setosa" | data$Species == "virginica", ],
  aes(x = Sepal.Width, y = Sepal.Length)
) +
  geom_point(aes(color = Species, shape = Species), size = 1.5) +
  geom_line(aes(linetype = Species)) +
  # Change the position of the legend
  theme(legend.position = "inside", legend.position.inside = c(0.85, 0.8))

p
```


### 4. Plotting with Genetic Data
@fig-GeneticData_plot shows a connected scatter plot of two genes related to breast cancer.

```{r fig4GeneticData_plot}
#| label: fig-GeneticData_plot
#| fig-cap: "Plotting with Genetic Data"
#| out.width: "95%"
#| warning: false

# Plotting with genetic data
p <- ggplot(data_counts, aes(x = V1, y = V2)) +
  geom_point(shape = 17, size = 1.5, color = "blue") +
  geom_line(orientation = "x", linetype = 1, color = "red", linewidth = 0.1) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) + # Avoid text overlap
  labs(x = axis_names[1], y = axis_names[2]) # Add x-axis and y-axis labels

p
```


### 5. Connect Points In Chronological Order

#### **Do not Connect Points in Chronological Order (For Comparison)**
@fig-ComparisonDiagram uses `geom_line()` for drawing. By default, `geom_line()` draws along the x-axis direction (it draws along the y-axis when `orientation="y"`).

```{r fig5ComparisonDiagram}
#| label: fig-ComparisonDiagram
#| fig-cap: "Comparison Diagram"
#| out.width: "95%"
#| warning: false

p <- ggplot(data_economics, aes(x = psavert, y = uempmed)) +
  geom_point(shape = 17, size = 1.5, color = "blue") +
  geom_text(
    label = data_economics$date, nudge_x = 0,
    nudge_y = -0.1, size = 3
  ) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 1)

p
```


#### **Connect Points in Chronological Order**
In @fig-ChronologicalOrder_plot, `geom_segment()` is used to connect points in chronological order, which results in a significant difference compared to the plot drawn with `geom_line()`.

```{r fig6ChronologicalOrder_plot}
#| label: fig-ChronologicalOrder_plot
#| fig-cap: "Connect Points in Chronological Order"
#| out.width: "95%"
#| warning: false

# Sort by date
data_economics <- data_economics[order(data_economics$date), ]

# Use `geom_segment()` to draw line segments
p <- ggplot(data_economics, aes(x = psavert, y = uempmed)) +
  geom_point(shape = 17, size = 1.5, color = "blue") +
  geom_text(
    label = data_economics$date, nudge_x = 0,
    nudge_y = -0.1, size = 5
  ) +
  geom_segment(
    aes(
      xend = c(tail(psavert, n = 24), NA),
      yend = c(tail(uempmed, n = 24), NA)
    ),
    linewidth = 1
  )

p
```


::: callout-tip
**Key Parameters: `geom_segment`**

`xend`,`yend`：

Corresponding to x and y, that is, drawing a line segment from `(x, y)` to `(xend, yend)`. In the code, `c(tail(psavert, n=24), NA)` takes the last 24 values of the `psavert` column and appends an NA. This makes each point point to the next one to draw a line segment, with the final point pointing to NA, thus not drawing a line segment.
:::

#### **Draw Arrows**
Arrows are added to each line segment in @fig-DrawArrows, making the chronological features in the connected scatter plot more apparent.

```{r fig7DrawArrows}
#| label: fig-DrawArrows
#| fig-cap: "Draw Arrows"
#| out.width: "95%"
#| warning: false

# Sort by date
data_economics <- data_economics[order(data_economics$date), ]

# Use `geom_segment()` to draw line segments
p <- ggplot(data_economics, aes(x = psavert, y = uempmed)) +
  geom_point(shape = 17, size = 1.5, color = "blue") +
  geom_text(
    label = data_economics$date, nudge_x = 0,
    nudge_y = -0.1, size = 5
  ) +
  geom_segment(
    aes(
      xend = c(tail(psavert, n = 24), NA),
      yend = c(tail(uempmed, n = 24), NA)
    ),
    linewidth = 1, arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.5, "cm"))
  )

p
```
